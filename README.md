# FarmersMarket
Tinder like farmers market


AgroMart helps users find local farms in the area which provide condiments. The user can directly interact with the farms using our swipe interface and can easily add products which he likes. The user can then place the order, travel to the farm and collect the order.

Frontend: We mainly used Angular, Bootstrap and TypeScript for this. The customer can search for a particular product (either by text or by uploading a picture). The results can then be filtered based on price of product or/and location of farm. The user can know more about the product by clicking on product card and can keep adding the products he wishes to purchase, to the cart. Finally, the customer can checkout from his cart.

Backend: Machine Learning: The user can upload a picture of what he wants, this would filter his options, allowing him to select from what he needs.
